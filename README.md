# The Brainrot Development Environment

This development environment provides all the mental stimulation you could ever need to keep your focus during long coding sessions!

## Language and Syntax

This environment is designed to function with our own unique "brainrot" programming language. Source code files with this language are followed by the *.br* extension. This environment comes pre-equipped with syntax highlighting, keyword auto-complete, token matching, and error identification upon compilation.

| Keyword       | Syntax                       | Purpose          |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- | :--------------- |
| fuckItWeBall  | ( \<code_body> )  | Code entrypoint  |
| sus  | ( \<cond>, \<code_body>, \<incrementer> ) | Conditional code execution |
| stan | ( \<conditional>, \<code_body> ) | Repeated code execution |
| serving | ( \<initialization>, \<conditional>, \<incrementer>, \<code_body> ) | Repeated code execution (with predefined incrementation function) |
| rizz | ( \<return_type>, \<identifier>, ( \<arument_list> ), { \<code_body> } ) | Define an isolated execution environment |
| lore | ( \<type>, \<variable_name>, \<value> ) | Variable definitions |
| yap | ( \<output_string> ) | Print to standard out |
| sixSeven | ( \<variable_name>, \<inc_value> ) | Variable incrementation |
| sigma | ( \<variable_name>, \<value> ) | Deteremines value equivalence |
| alpha | ( \<variable_name>, \<value>) | Determines larger value |
| beta | ( \<variable_name>, \<value> ) | Determines smaller value |
| crashOut | ( \<value> ) | Return from the isolated code environment with a designated value |
| tweak | () | Return from the isolated code environment |
